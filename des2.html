				<dt><b>Introduction:</b></dt>
					<dd>The chariot path is the route which Ravana transported Sita Devi on his chariot from Sita Kotuwa 
					to Ashoka Vatika also known as Ravana grass pathway which is located jungle on the top of Ramboda Hills on the Kandy – Nuwara Eliya 
					main road. This is one of the iconic Ramayana sites in Sri Lanka.
					The Sita tear pond is a small pond that can be found en-route by the chariot path. A pond located on this Chariot Path is believed to have been
					formed here by the tears of Sita Devi and has not dried up so far even during severe droughts when the adjoining rivers do. 
					It is located on top of a mountain range in the central highlands of Sri Lanka which has spectacular views from an angle of 360 degrees around.</dd>

				<dt><b>Route:</b></dt>
					<dd>Starting your journey from Colombo, you will first need to reach Gampola. From Gampola, take a bus to Pussallawa village, where you should hire a car 
					capable of handling rough roads to get to Frotoft estate/Perettasi village, a trip that takes about 1.5 to 2 hours. Buses are an alternative, but they are infrequent. 
					Upon arrival, locate the old hospital facility where the trailhead begins. The hike through the tea estate is relatively easy, but the climb along the footpath is more 
					challenging and takes 2 to 3 hours. Along the way, you'll enjoy scenic views of Kotmale Reservoir, Pidurangala, Hanguranketha, Sri Padaya, and Hewaheta, making it worthwhile
					to spend at least half a day exploring this Ramayana site. Be prepared for chilly weather and wind, especially at night, and wear long-sleeved clothing to protect yourself from the 
					spiky grass. Note that this journey is not suitable for senior citizens or those with heart or respiratory issues.</dd>
