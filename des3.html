    <dt><b>Introduction:</b></dt>
      <dd>Kabaragala is the highest mountain peak within the Dolosbage range, soaring approximately 1506 meters above sea level</dd>

    <dt><b>Route:</b></dt>
      <dd>Your exploration of Kabaragala kicks off at the Maryville Junction. As you embark on this journey,
      you traverse through a variety of terrains, each contributing to the charm of the adventure. The expedition 
      starts with a stop at a Kovil, then proceeds along a concrete road leading to the mountain. As you step into a tea estate,
      the path becomes narrower, funneling you onto a slim but clearly marked trail.
      As you advance, a quaint forest filled with pine trees welcomes you. After about an hour of hiking, you arrive at the 
      first viewpoint – a spot that offers breathtaking views of the landscape around you. This is a moment that truly rewards the effort of the trek.
      While the first viewpoint marks a common stopping point for many hikers, the true beauty of Kabaragala awaits those who venture further. The terrain closely mirrors Horton Plains, 
      showcasing mana trees and savanna-type plants. The remarkable drop towards the bottom, reminiscent of the world's end, adds an element of thrill and wonder.

      After an invigorating two-hour hike, you'll stand triumphant at the summit of Kabaragala Mountain. The view from this vantage point is nothing short of breathtaking. The panorama
      encompasses the Kothmale Reservoir, Peacock Hills, Kothmale Area, Dolosbage Area, Pusellawa, Ambuluwawa, and the iconic Sri Pada Mountain. Additionally, you'll be able to gaze upon 
      lesser-known mountains and quaint villages. Photographers will find themselves in paradise, especially during the early morning when mist blankets the landscape. Keep an eye out for
      the captivating sight of clouds nestled beneath the mountains, a signature feature of Kabaragala.</dd>
      <dt><b>Transportation:</b></dt>
      <dd>Reaching Kabaragala is an adventure with two primary routes for exploration. One starts from Nawalapitiya, while the other originates from the Gampola side. The distances
